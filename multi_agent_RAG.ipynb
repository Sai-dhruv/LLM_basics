    "# **Agentic RAG for Analyzing Customer Issues: A Comprehensive Tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a groundbreaking AI technique that boosts the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating real-time document retrieval during text generation. Traditional RAG methods, such as Naive RAG, can falter when faced with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Enter **Agentic RAG**, which combines RAG's retrieval capabilities with autonomous decision-making agents, offering unparalleled performance in handling intricate queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a hands-on guide to building an Agentic RAG system for analyzing customer issues, using Python and key libraries like **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, **Gradio**, and **ChromaDB**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "- Understand the key differences between Agentic RAG and Naive RAG.\n",
    "- Explore the limitations of Naive RAG in handling complex queries.\n",
    "- Discover real-world use cases where Agentic RAG excels.\n",
    "- Implement Agentic RAG in Python using CrewAI.\n",

    "## **Agentic RAG: Strengthening Naive RAG**\n",
    "Agentic RAG enhances Naive RAG by adding autonomous decision-making agents capable of iterative reasoning. In Naive RAG, the retriever is passive, fetching information only when prompted. In contrast, Agentic RAG integrates **agents** that actively decide:\n",
    "- **When** to retrieve information.\n",
    "- **What** information to retrieve.\n",
    "- **How** to synthesize the retrieved data for actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Limitations of Naive RAG**\n",
    "Naive RAG struggles with:\n",
    "- **Summarization Questions**: E.g., \"Summarize this document.\"\n",
    "- **Comparative Analysis**: E.g., \"Compare PepsiCo's and Coca-Cola's Q4 2023 strategies.\"\n",
    "- **Complex Multi-Part Queries**: E.g., \"Analyze retail inflation arguments in articles from *The Mint* and *Economic Times*, compare findings, and provide conclusions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic RAG addresses these challenges by incorporating reasoning agents capable of handling such queries effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Use Cases of Agentic RAG**\n",
    "1. **Legal Research**: Compare legal documents to extract key clauses.\n",
    "2. **Market Analysis**: Analyze and compare top brands in a product segment.\n",
    "3. **Medical Diagnosis**: Combine patient data with research for diagnoses.\n",
    "4. **Financial Analysis**: Summarize and compare financial reports.\n",
